Slimjet - относительно "молодой" браузер, созданный на движке Chromium. Этот движок нынче используют. Please, I have never opened my Box (CPU). Is a good (rare in Brazil ) who come to my apartment rare sometimes. I use 1 unique partition on HD, Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bits. I am a newbie, and I look for another browser (I have SlimJet excellent), But I would like to use or ICECAT or ABROWSER (this last one I cannot find own site on web.), though people talking about both over there). Do I would need to download some Linux in my solely partition? (I have some terror, dificults agains.

I like this wallet from Matt and Nat (https://mattandnat.com/shop/men-s/wallets/york-black/) because it has an outside pocket (or two, I can't really tell) for my metro card. I have heard that they aren't exactly kind to their employees (https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/5i7guj/the_vegan_fashion_company_matt_and_nat_is/) and that they don't use the most environmentally friendly materials (https://mygreencloset.com/no-longer-buy-matt-nat/) so I'd rather buy from someone else. There's. comedy.co.uk I tried to open it with FF (Pale Moon) and Chrome (SlimJet) but it just timesout. Tried disabling uBO, but still nothing. I can ping it from cmd though, and checking isitdown it says it's up and running. Same behavior on laptop, phone, and tablet. Any ideas how I can fix this? Thank. I found a recommendation for SlimJet as an alternate browser on Slant.co and by checking their website it seems like a worthy contender in the browser market. The browser is based on Chromium but don't send usage data to Google. They have tracking prevention options (https://www.slimjet.com/en/webhelp/tracking-prevention-options.htm), ad blocker (https://www.slimjet.com/en/webhelp/ad-blocker.htm), multiple connection download manager, bookmark syncing, customizable toolbar and tabs, youtu. Ok, it is bit of a obscure request. I used to use a modified chromium browser called Slimjet. It had a lot of nifty features but had terrible performance. One feature was exceptionally useful to me was a option in tab context menu called "Close all tabs from this domain". It was really helpful if I went gung ho on reddit binge or in similar situation. So I was wodering if there is a way to use CSS to create that functionality in FF? Here is a ScreenShot (https://i.imgur.com/nvx3baS.png) 
Hey guys, I'm a long time PlayStation user, but I've found myself in a bit of a predicament. I have two PlayStation 4s, both the original 500 gb model. With many games taking a large chunk of hard drive space, I'm missing out on playing some bigger games and other games with friends. I've thought about selling my two systems after buying one either a Slim or Pro with a 1tb hard drive to have all my games on one system. What I have to decide is which to buy. From my research, the Slim isn't I found it at a store(Asian region)I am getting this No bundle - simple jet black PS4 slim E12 2006B B01 P27452391F S01- 5698xxx-x PS4 slim jet black 1TB. Got photo from someone and 4k HDR is not written on the left of the 1TB in blue colour. The box is blue at bottom and white above the blue wave and has slim photo and controller photo in the front. Please any feedback would be helpful as leaving the city in few hours. I bit costly but can't do anything , we have to pay the price Edit: Thanks, all! Case closed. Hi, all. Quick question about the FBI background check (USA). The background check shows two things I was arrested for (DUI most notable), though I was only convicted of reckless driving. I noted on my application the reckless driving and the final court date. I also spoke with the interviewers briefly about the situation, saying I was arrested for a DUI, but was only convicted of reckless driving. The fact that the FBI check says DUI in huge bold letters I did a search but haven't found much recent discussion on this. TL;DR What Linux should I run on a 1 GHz dual core AMD / 2 GB RAM / touch screen only tablet? Has USB and keyboard dock so occasional keyboard use is fine but would want to be able to operate normally without it Recently I dug out my old Acer netbook (1.6 GHz Atom, 1 GB RAM) and couldn't imagine it running anything modern besides linux. I have very very limited experience with Ubuntu so with no expectations I installed Lubuntu. I haven't changed a thing. I'm using the latest version of SlimJet (based on Chrome) and the latest Lastpass Chrome extension. I've never had a problem in 2+ years. The past week I have been unable to use the extension - my email address is not saved (though the option is checked), so I have to type that in along with the password.nothing. I have been forced to use the LastPass website and the login vault from the site. What I have done: - Removed the Lastpass Extension - Reinstalled the Lastp. 
Since there have been links to actual dangerous material posted now, and fears of a honeypot type operation are rising, I figured it was important for all of us to at least be aware of how we can stay relatively safe. That way we can just point people back to this resource and keep all the legitimate concern comments to a minimum and focus on the actual investigation. A few things to note first: - There are always multiple points of failure. Each piece of security advice ignored, means TL;DR My laptop is weak but IE11 and SlimJet perform nicely while Firefox, EDGE, and Pale Moon perform horribly when watching streams using FLASH. When they move to HTML5, I'll try again. I don't know if it's because of Windows 10 but my laptop handles Flash streams horribly, mainly Twitch and Hitbox. The thing about it is that IE11 and SlimJet(for those that don't know, it is a Chromium-variant) handle the streams nicely. At the same time they don't consume as much battery as Firefox. Running. Title, I’m installing Spider-Man and I expect my PS4 to take off any minute now. thanks in advance Anyone got links for any PS4 Pro deals for this Black Friday/cyber Monday? I’m in Canada. Cheers! Edit: EB Games is having a promotion (22nd-26th) where if you trade in an old working PS4 (w/ power cable and controller) you can pick up a PS4 Slim + Spider-Man for 80$. As for PS4 Pro, it’s looking like the 500$ bundle I'm mainly going to play FIFA, NHL and UFC, so I'm wondering if I should get the PS4 Pro or Slim. Going to play on a 24 inch 144hz BenQ monitor most of the time, unless I take it downstairs to hook it up to my old ass telly.
