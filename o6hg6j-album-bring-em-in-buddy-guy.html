I live and breathe the genre. Writing scary prose isn't just a hobby for me: it's my passion. So imagine my surprise when I was asked to write a biography. No, not for Stephen King or Edgar Allan Poe. But an authorized biography for the one and only Nicki Minaj. Yeah, I was shocked too when I first read that mysterious e-mail. The offer even said I'd be given full credit. not to mention insane pay. And all I had to do was just give the L.A. phone number a call. Artist : Pacific Division a.k.a.

Warning: contains mature themes and language. ### Late October '14 I woke up driving an eighteen-wheeler 60 miles per hour through a field east of Amarillo, Texas. My partner was screaming as he bounced around in the back; he had just woken up, too. Everything in the truck rattled and shook. Baggage rained down on me from the upper bunk. The view a dark blur, I slammed on the brakes, but 80,000 pounds of inertia wasn't going 
Hi guys, below is a segment I wrote a while back for a Hotline Miami based novel. Would love to know what you guys think; any feedback is welcome! Segment Below: “Ughhhh Hmph Ahhhh,” moaned Vasili, clutching his head. “What the ACTUAL FUCK happened last night?!” blood dripping from his mouth and small cuts on his arms and legs onto the small, dirty mattress as he lay there in excruciating pain. He leaned over and reached for the painkillers sprawled across the top of the cardboard box acting.

I want to write to you about my first trip to Seattle. I mainly went up there to see the band Halestorm. My close cousin lives near there. He offered to pick me up and let me crash at his place. I seized the opportunity to hangout in South Seattle near the SafeCo baseball stadium. This is where the Seattle Mariners play. Now, I'm on the Bolt Bus back to Portland. The first music genre I was obsessed with was classic guitar rock. I have fond early memories of my dad's brown cassette I began listening to The Gizz in 2015, sometime after Quarters! was released. The music video for "The River" is was had me hooked. I couldn't stop listening to that song it was incredible. I was a huge dead head at the time (still am) so its length and groovy-ness was right up my ally. I had bought the song and was listening to it constantly. My friends began to stop letting me choose the music cause they knew it was coming every single time. Now, at this point i had not stumbled into the rabbi. #Artist: Drake ( #Album: Views ( Listen: Apple Music ( https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/views/id1108742399) Spotify (https://open.spotify.com/album/40GMAhriYJRO1rsY4YdrZb) Tidal (https://listen.tidal.com/album/60100918) Google Play ( https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Drake_Views?id=Bzmwxwhctn3r5ngzkl4ozy3vgkaamphl=en_GB) Background 2014 seems like forever ago writing Hey-o folks we're back again for our second Album of the Year 2017 write-up of the day!

Hey guys! Back again for a bit - this time wasn't quite a month, at least? D: ampnbsp; Mid-season finale two-parter is here, and it's a doozy. Get hype. ampnbsp; If you need to catch, past posts are here: Episodes 1 - 3 (https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/4d3ou4/pony_reacts_blindly_to_steven_universe_episodes_13/) Episodes 4 - 6 (https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/4dhbwx/pony_blindly_reacts_to_steven_universe_episodes_46/) Episodes ### Previously (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7yjx1w/roleplay_the_ballad_of_harv_and_kev_part_4/) Harvey Weinstein’s Mansion Having successfully gotten ahold of some presumably damning evidence about the activities Steven Spielberg (who we now knew to be tribal Minister of Goyish Affairs Samuel), Bryan Singer, Dan Schneider, and multiple powerful unnamed entertainment executives, the Hollywood Heavyweights returned to the home of Harvey Weinstein for something resembling. ### Previously (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/85gn9q/meta_how_to_peel_an_onion_the_worldpowers/) Onion’s Lair A short while after the first meeting of the Alliance to Defeat the Big Brains, Onion and Mike had left Paris and retired to the former’s villainous lair, somewhere in Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Being both villainous and a lair, it took the form of a fortress built into the side of a mountain in the middle of a forest. Although forests are typically associated with goodnes. Hi guys! Pony here, coming at you with my very first Steven Universe blind reaction post! ampnbsp; If you didn't see my introduction post (https://www.reddit.com/r/stevenuniverse/comments/4cjilg/any_interest_in_blind_reactions_from_a_newbie/), I'm completely new to Steven Universe, but since I've enjoyed watching/reading blind reactions from others to different shows in the past, I thought I'd take a shot at doing a blind reaction series myself! I am completely spoiler ### Previously (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7yrlgv/roleplay_the_ballad_of_harv_and_kev_part_5/) Carlton Way Park For some strange reason, Ronan Farrow had requested that the Hollywood Heavyweights meet him in Carlton Way Park, the premiere skating park in the greater Los Angeles area.

Hello /r/stevenuniverse! It’s been too long, I know, but the universe has really not been too fond of me watching and commenting on Steven Universe, if you know what I mean. But now I’m back, and I’m so ready to post this, mostly because it means I can FINALLY WATCH MORE OF THIS SHOW! ampnbsp; Part 1 is the reactions. These are my immediate reactions to the episodes, which I catalogue on my first. Tell us a little about yourself. I usually say “Oh, I hate talking about myself” when prompted with this question, but I won’t do that, even though I kinda just did. Screw your rules, me. Kinda. Anyway, my name is Sade. I’ll be 27 in two weeks, which means I can finally die and join the 27 club. Just need to get famous real quick.

### Previously (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/7ofjdr/roleplay_exit_light_part_2/) ## Darkplace Episode 12 Darkplace Sheriff’s Station It was the morning of the 27th of December in Darkplace, and the holiday period was well underway. Two days removed from the rise and fall of Santa Le Foll, Sheriff Harry Wilson was waiting in the conference room of the sheriff's station for any kind of word from Agents MacLachlan and Cintron. Also in the room was the official unofficial. Hello, fellow Watchies. During an intense and enlightening lab session with my teammates last night on Gibraltar, I decided to study and analyze all my favorite spots to sit and randomly lob arrows at the enemy while desperately hoping that enough will hit to rationalize all that real life money I spent on loot boxes. Now, I play as Hanzo, not Widowmaker, so this write-up specifically has this character in mind. I also don't exactly "snipe," so maybe "snipe spot" isn't as accurate as "danger. Remember what being best friends with someone is like? Like early teens 6-8th grade? Or even high school I guess. It was fucking great, wasn't it? Spending the whole summer with each other literally doing whatever the fuck you wanna do. Not a fucking care in the world. No responsibility. No accountability. Nothing. I forgot what having a best friend was like after I got into hard drugs. The meaning of the phrase "hanging out" changes into getting money together, getting shit and getting high. </p>
